   Here are some helper functions for your testing of set-like lists.
 ********************************************************************)

(** [cmp_set_like_lists lst1 lst2] compares two lists to see whether
    they are equivalent set-like lists. That means checking two things.
    First, they must both be {i set-like}, meaning that they do not
    contain any duplicates. Second, they must contain the same elements,
    though not necessarily in the same order. *)
let cmp_set_like_lists lst1 lst2 =
  let uniq1 = List.sort_uniq compare lst1 in
  let uniq2 = List.sort_uniq compare lst2 in
  List.length lst1 = List.length uniq1
  && List.length lst2 = List.length uniq2
  && uniq1 = uniq2

(** [pp_string s] pretty-prints string [s]. *)
let pp_string s = "\"" ^ s ^ "\""

(** [pp_list pp_elt lst] pretty-prints list [lst], using [pp_elt] to
    pretty-print each element of [lst]. *)
let pp_list pp_elt lst =
  let pp_elts lst =
    let rec loop n acc = function
      | [] -> acc
      | [ h ] -> acc ^ pp_elt h
      | h1 :: (h2 :: t as t') ->
          if n = 100 then acc ^ "..." (* stop printing long list *)
          else loop (n + 1) (acc ^ pp_elt h1 ^ "; ") t'
    in
    loop 0 "" lst
  in
  "[" ^ pp_elts lst ^ "]"

(* These tests demonstrate how to use [cmp_set_like_lists] and [pp_list]
   to get helpful output from OUnit. *)
let cmp_demo =
  [
    ( "order is irrelevant" >:: fun _ ->
      assert_equal ~cmp:cmp_set_like_lists ~printer:(pp_list pp_string)
        [ "foo"; "bar" ] [ "bar"; "foo" ] );
    (* Uncomment this test to see what happens when a test case fails. (
       "duplicates not allowed" >:: fun _ -> assert_equal
       ~cmp:cmp_set_like_lists ~printer:(pp_list pp_string) [ "foo";
       "foo" ] [ "foo" ] ); *)
